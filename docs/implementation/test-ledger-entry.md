# Add Ledger Entry Feature Test

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully added the "Add Ledger Entry" button next to the "Add Expense" button in the page header. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added `handleAddPayment` to data handlers** (`src/hooks/use-data-handlers.ts`):
   - Created a new payment handler that uploads receipts and creates payment entries
   - Includes proper error handling and toast notifications
   - Supports both income and expense categories with optional reasons

2. **Updated main app component** (`src/components/apargo-app.tsx`):
   - Added `handleAddPayment` to the destructured handlers
   - Passed the payment handler and users array to SidebarLayout

3. **Updated sidebar layout** (`src/components/layout/sidebar-layout.tsx`):
   - Added payment handler and users to the props interface
   - Passed these props to PageHeader

4. **Updated page header** (`src/components/layout/page-header.tsx`):
   - Added import for AddPaymentDialog
   - Added payment handler and users to props interface
   - Added the new "Add Ledger Entry" button next to "Add Expense"
   - Used primary button styling to differentiate from the expense button

### Features:

- **Add Ledger Entry Button**: Located next to the "Add Expense" button in the header
- **Payment Dialog**: Uses the existing AddPaymentDialog component which includes:
  - Category selection (Income/Expense)
  - Payee selection from users
  - Amount input
  - Month & Year selection
  - Optional receipt upload
  - Optional reason field for expenses
- **Integration**: Fully integrated with the existing payment system and firestore backend
- **Responsive**: Button text hides on small screens, showing only the icon

### Button Styling:
- "Add Expense": Uses accent color (orange)
- "Add Ledger Entry": Uses primary color (blue) to distinguish the two actions

The implementation reuses the existing AddPaymentDialog component and integrates seamlessly with the current architecture.
