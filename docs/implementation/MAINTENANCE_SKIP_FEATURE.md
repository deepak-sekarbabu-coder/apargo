# Skip Maintenance Task Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a "Skip" feature for recurring maintenance tasks that allows users to postpone a task and automatically reschedule it to the next recurrence interval based on the current date.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Model

**MaintenanceTaskStatus Type Update**

- Added `'skipped'` as a new status option
- Supports status transition: `scheduled` → `skipped`

**MaintenanceTask Interface Update**

- Added `skippedDate?: string` field to track when a task was skipped
- Maintains data consistency with existing `completedDate` pattern

### 2. Skip Logic Implementation

**Utility Functions** (`src/lib/maintenance-utils.ts`)

- `shouldCreateRecurringTaskOnSkip()`: Determines if a skipped task should generate a new recurring instance
- `createRecurringTaskFromSkipped()`: Creates a new recurring task based on a skipped task
- Uses current skip date + recurrence interval for scheduling (vs completion date for completed tasks)

**Recurrence Calculation**

- Monthly: Skip date + 1 month
- Quarterly: Skip date + 3 months
- Semi-annual: Skip date + 6 months
- Annual: Skip date + 1 year

### 3. Backend Integration

**Firestore Updates** (`src/lib/firestore.ts`)

- Enhanced `updateMaintenanceTask()` to handle skipped status
- Automatic recurring task creation when status changes to 'skipped'
- Preserves all task properties (title, description, vendor, cost estimate, etc.)
- Resets skip/completion specific data for new tasks

### 4. UI Components

**Skip Button** (`src/components/maintenance/maintenance-dashboard.tsx`)

- Only visible for recurring tasks (`recurrence !== 'none'`)
- Hidden for completed, cancelled, or already skipped tasks
- Orange color scheme with SkipForward icon
- Integrates with existing action button layout

**Status Configuration**

- Added skipped status with orange color theme
- Proper icon (SkipForward) and styling consistency
- Badge display for skipped tasks

**Task Organization**

- Skipped tasks excluded from "Upcoming & Active" section
- New "Skipped Tasks" section displays recently skipped tasks
- Collapsible UI with task count display
- Shows up to 5 most recent skipped tasks

### 5. Event Handling

**Maintenance View Updates** (`src/components/maintenance/maintenance-view.tsx`)

- Enhanced `handleUpdateStatus()` to set `skippedDate` when status becomes 'skipped'
- Maintains consistency with existing completion date handling
- Automatic timestamp assignment

## User Experience

### Skip Workflow

1. User views a recurring maintenance task (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
2. User clicks "Skip" button if task cannot be completed now
3. Current task status changes to "skipped" with timestamp
4. New recurring task automatically created with date = current date + recurrence interval
5. New task appears in "Upcoming & Active" section
6. Skipped task appears in "Skipped Tasks" section

### Visual Design

- **Skip Button**: Orange outline button with SkipForward icon
- **Skipped Status Badge**: Orange theme consistent with skip button
- **Skipped Tasks Section**: Orange left border, collapsible design
- **Task Cards**: Reuse existing CompletedTaskCard component for consistency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

```
User clicks Skip → handleUpdateStatus() → updateMaintenanceTask() →
shouldCreateRecurringTaskOnSkip() → createRecurringTaskFromSkipped() →
addMaintenanceTask() → UI updates
```

### State Management

- Added `skippedCollapsed` state for UI section control
- `allSkippedTasks` computed property for task filtering
- Reuses existing pagination patterns where needed

### Error Handling

- Validation for non-recurring tasks (skip button hidden)
- Graceful handling of recurring task creation failures
- Consistent error patterns with existing completion logic

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests

- `shouldCreateRecurringTaskOnSkip()` validation
- `createRecurringTaskFromSkipped()` functionality
- Recurrence calculation accuracy for all intervals
- Edge cases (month overflow, leap years)

### Integration Tests

- Skip button visibility logic
- Status transition workflows
- UI component behavior
- Task filtering and categorization

### Edge Cases Handled

- Non-recurring tasks (skip button hidden)
- Already completed/cancelled/skipped tasks
- Tasks without recurrence patterns
- Month boundary calculations
- Leap year date handling

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Files Modified

1. `src/lib/types.ts` - Added skipped status and skippedDate field
2. `src/lib/maintenance-utils.ts` - Added skip utility functions
3. `src/lib/firestore.ts` - Enhanced updateMaintenanceTask function
4. `src/components/maintenance/maintenance-dashboard.tsx` - Added skip UI and logic
5. `src/components/maintenance/maintenance-view.tsx` - Enhanced status handling

### Test Files Created

1. `tests/maintenance/test-skip-functionality.js` - Comprehensive skip tests
2. `tests/maintenance/test-skip-utils.ts` - Skip utility function tests

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- **Bulk Skip Operations**: Skip multiple tasks at once
- **Skip Reasons**: Optional reason field for why task was skipped
- **Skip Analytics**: Track skip patterns and frequencies
- **Custom Skip Intervals**: Allow users to specify custom reschedule dates
- **Skip Notifications**: Notify when tasks are skipped vs completed

### Advanced Features

- **Skip Limits**: Prevent tasks from being skipped too many times
- **Escalation**: Auto-escalate tasks skipped multiple times
- **Skip Approval**: Require admin approval for certain task skips
- **Skip History**: Detailed audit trail of skip actions

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing tasks without skippedDate field continue to work normally
- All existing functionality for completed, cancelled tasks unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Graceful handling of tasks created before skip feature

## Performance Considerations

- Skip logic reuses existing recurrence calculation functions
- Minimal database queries (single update + optional recurring task creation)
- UI sections only render when tasks exist (conditional rendering)
- Efficient task filtering using existing memoization patterns

## Accessibility

- Skip button follows existing accessibility patterns
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance for orange theme
