# Firebase Storage Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a centralized Firebase Storage configuration for the Apargo application that optimizes Firebase's free tier usage while providing comprehensive file management capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Centralized Storage Bucket Configuration

- **Single Storage Bucket**: All file uploads now use `unicorndev-b532a.firebasestorage.app`
- **Organized File Structure**: Files are organized by category (`/uploads/receipts/`, `/uploads/faults/`, `/uploads/avatars/`, `/uploads/announcements/`)
- **Free Tier Optimization**: Consolidated storage maximizes the 5GB Firebase free tier quota

### 2. Strict File Size Limits (2MB)

- **Enforced at Multiple Levels**: Client-side validation, server-side validation, and API endpoint validation
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Clear feedback when files exceed the 2MB limit
- **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate feedback during file selection
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual upload progress with file size information

### 3. Enhanced File Upload System

- **File Validation Service**: `StorageService` class with comprehensive validation
- **Metadata Storage**: All file metadata stored in Firestore `fileMetadata` collection
- **Multiple Upload Categories**: Support for receipts, faults, avatars, and announcements
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Enhanced UI with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time progress tracking with percentage and file information

### 4. Admin File Management Interface

- **Role-Based Access**: Only users with `role: 'admin'` can access file management
- **Comprehensive File Listing**: Display all uploaded files with metadata
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by category, age (3+ months), uploader, and search by filename
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and delete multiple files at once
- **Storage Statistics**: Dashboard showing total files, storage usage, and old files
- **Age-Based Cleanup**: Identify and delete files older than 3 months

### 5. API Endpoints

- **Enhanced Upload API**: `POST /api/storage/upload` with metadata storage
- **Upload Configuration**: `GET /api/storage/upload` returns size limits and allowed types
- **Admin File Management**: `GET /api/admin/files` with filtering capabilities
- **Bulk File Deletion**: `DELETE /api/admin/files` for batch operations
- **Storage Statistics**: `GET /api/admin/storage/stats` for admin dashboard

### 6. Updated UI Components

- **Enhanced Fault Reporting Form**: Now uses the new storage system with improved UX
- **Admin Panel Integration**: File management added as a new tab in the admin interface
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during upload operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and user guidance

### Configuration Details

```typescript
// Storage Configuration
export const STORAGE_CONFIG: StorageConfig = {
  maxFileSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2MB in bytes
  allowedMimeTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'application/pdf'],
  bucket: 'unicorndev-b532a.firebasestorage.app',
  baseUploadPath: 'uploads',
};
```

### File Organization Structure

```
/storage-bucket
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /uploads
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /receipts/{timestamp}_{filename}
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /faults/{timestamp}_{filename}
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /avatars/{userId}_{timestamp}_{filename}
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /announcements/{timestamp}_{filename}
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /metadata (stored in Firestore)
```
