# Category-Based No-Split Feature Flag System

## Overview

This feature implements a flexible, configurable system for controlling which expense categories should be split among apartments and which should remain as personal expenses. Instead of hardcoding specific category names, this system uses a feature flag approach that allows administrators to configure any category's splitting behavior.

## Key Features

### üéØ Configurable Split Logic

- Each category now has an optional `noSplit` boolean field
- When `noSplit: true`, expenses in that category won't be divided among apartments
- When `noSplit: false` (or undefined), expenses are split equally among all apartments

### ‚öôÔ∏è Admin Interface Control

- Administrators can toggle the no-split setting for any category via the admin interface
- Visual "No Split" badge appears next to categories that have this setting enabled
- Easy to configure without code changes

### üîÑ Backward Compatibility

- Legacy string-based logic still supported for existing systems
- Gradual migration path from hardcoded "cleaning" category logic
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### üìä Enhanced User Experience

- Clear visual indicators in the admin interface
- Intuitive category management with explanatory text
- Immediate feedback when creating expenses

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/types.ts`**
   - Added `noSplit?: boolean` field to Category type

2. **`scripts/insertCategories.ts`**
   - Updated category data to include `noSplit` field
   - Cleaning category set to `noSplit: true` by default

3. **`src/lib/payment-utils.ts`**
   - Updated `distributePayment` function to check `category.noSplit`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with string-based logic

4. **`src/components/apargo-app.tsx`**
   - Modified expense splitting logic to use `category.noSplit`
   - Dynamic success messages based on category configuration

5. **`src/components/expenses/expense-item.tsx`**
   - Updated to use Category type instead of inline type definition
   - Payment tracking hidden for no-split expenses

6. **`src/components/admin/admin-view.tsx`**
   - Added visual "No Split" badge for configured categories

7. **`src/components/dialogs/add-category-dialog.tsx`**
   - Added checkbox for "No Split Expense" setting with explanation

8. **`src/components/dialogs/edit-category-dialog.tsx`**
   - Added checkbox for toggling "No Split Expense" setting

### Data Structure

```typescript
type Category = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string;
  noSplit?: boolean; // Feature flag: when true, expenses won't be split
};
```

### Logic Flow

```javascript
// In expense creation logic
const category = getCategoryById(newExpenseData.categoryId);
const isNoSplitExpense = category?.noSplit === true;

if (isNoSplitExpense) {
  // Only paying apartment bears the cost
  expenseWithApartmentDebts = {
    ...newExpenseData,
    paidByApartment: payingApartmentId,
    owedByApartments: [],
    perApartmentShare: 0,
    paidByApartments: [],
  };
} else {
  // Split equally among all apartments
  // ... standard splitting logic
}
```

## Benefits

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural

- **Flexible**: Any category can be configured as no-split
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new categories with custom splitting behavior
- **Maintainable**: No hardcoded category names in business logic

### üë• User Experience

- **Intuitive**: Clear visual indicators and explanatory text
- **Accessible**: Admin interface provides easy configuration
- **Transparent**: Users understand which expenses will be split

### üîß Technical

- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Default Categories Configuration

```javascript
const categories = [
  { name: 'Utilities', icon: 'üè†', noSplit: false }, // Will be split
  { name: 'Cleaning', icon: 'üßπ', noSplit: true }, // Won't be split
  { name: 'Maintenance', icon: 'üîß', noSplit: false }, // Will be split
  { name: 'Personal', icon: 'üë§', noSplit: true }, // Won't be split
];
```

### Admin Workflow

1. Navigate to Admin ‚Üí Category Management
2. Click edit button on any category
3. Toggle "No Split Expense" checkbox
4. Save changes
5. Visual "No Split" badge appears immediately

### Expense Creation Impact

- **Split Categories**: Success message indicates how many apartments the expense was split among and the amount owed.
- **No-Split Categories**: "‚Çπ200 cleaning expense added. Only your apartment will bear this cost."

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Systems

1. Run the updated `insertCategories.ts` script to add `noSplit` fields
2. Existing categories without `noSplit` field default to splitting behavior
3. Legacy string-based logic continues to work during transition

### For New Installations

- All categories are configured with appropriate `noSplit` values from the start
- No additional migration steps required

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Split vs no-split expense scenarios
- Feature flag configuration flexibility
- Backward compatibility with legacy logic
- UI state management and visual indicators

Run tests with:

```bash
node tests/test-category-no-split-feature.js
node tests/test-enhanced-expense-splitting.js
```

## Future Enhancements

This foundation supports potential future features:

- Per-apartment category preferences
- Time-based splitting rules
- Complex splitting algorithms (weighted, percentage-based)
- Category-specific payment terms
- Automated expense categorization

**Note**: This feature maintains full backward compatibility while providing a robust foundation for future expense management enhancements.
