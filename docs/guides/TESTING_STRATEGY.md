# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Apargo application.

## Testing Pyramid

We follow the testing pyramid approach, with a focus on unit tests, followed by integration tests, and a small number of end-to-end tests.

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between multiple components and services.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test the complete application flow from the user's perspective.

## Tools

- **Jest**: For running tests.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing.

## Running Tests

- `npm test`: Run all tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests.

## Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all new components and functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests for all new features.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Write end-to-end tests for all critical user flows.
