## 1. Project Overview

| Item                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | A web-based property-management portal that lets residents and administrators view dashboards, file fault reports, track expenses, receive real-time push notifications, and interact with data stored in Firebase.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Primary Stack**   | **React 18** + **Next.js 16 (App Router with Turbopack)**, **TypeScript 5**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Firebase 11** (Client + Admin SDK), **Radix UI** components, **TanStack React Query** for data fetching, **Service Workers** for offline support, **Jest** for unit testing, **Recharts** for analytics visualization, and a set of **Node.js** scripts for deployment, data-seeding, and maintenance. |
| **Target Audience** | Residents, property managers and administrators of an apartment complex. The UI is a responsive SPA that works on desktop and mobile browsers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Key Use-Cases**   | • Dashboard-viewing with real-time analytics<br>• Fault reporting (auto-submit on file upload)<br>• Expense tracking with category breakdown<br>• Payment event management<br>• Real-time notifications<br>• Admin management of user-apartment assignments<br>• Community features (announcements, polls)<br>• Maintenance task scheduling<br>• Vendor management                                      |

## 2. Architecture & Routing Model

> **⚡ TL;DR:** The project **uses the Next.js App Router exclusively**. The legacy `src/pages` folder is kept only for a few **static files** that have not yet been migrated.

### 2.1 Folder Layout & Routing

```
src/
├─ app/               – App Router pages & server actions
│   ├─ (dashboard)/page.tsx   → /dashboard
│   ├─ (login)/page.tsx       → /login
│   └─ api/...                → Server-only API routes (exposed as /api/**)
├─ components/        – Re-usable UI components (organized by feature)
│   ├─ admin/         – Admin dashboard & tools
│   ├─ analytics/     – Analytics dashboard & charts
│   ├─ auth/          – Authentication forms
│   ├─ community/     – Community features (announcements, polls)
│   ├─ core/          – Core app shell & providers
│   ├─ dashboard/     – Dashboard widgets
│   ├─ maintenance/   – Maintenance & vendor management
│   ├─ payment-events/– Payment event tracking
│   ├─ ui/            – Radix UI primitives
│   └─ ...
├─ lib/               – Core logic & utilities (organized by feature)
│   ├─ auth/          – Authentication logic
│   ├─ core/          – Core constants & types
│   ├─ firebase/      – Firebase SDK initialization
│   ├─ firestore/     – Data access layer
│   └─ ...
public/
├─ sw-optimized.js   – Production service-worker
├─ sw.js              – Fallback service-worker
├─ firebase-messaging-sw.js   – FCM worker (v11 compat)
├─ firebase-messaging-sw.js (legacy v8) – kept for reference only
└─ …                  – Static assets (icons, test pages, etc.)
scripts/               – Maintenance / seeding scripts
tests/                 – Jest unit-test suites
.next/                 – Generated build artefacts
...
```

### 2.2 Legacy `src/pages` folder

- **What it contains:** Only static files such as `robots.txt` or legacy HTML that were never part of the App Router.
- **Important:** **Next.js never serves files from `src/pages` as static assets.** If you need a file to be publicly reachable, move it to `public/` or delete it.
- **Migration tip:** Run the following once to spot any stray files:

```bash
git ls-files src/pages | xargs -I{} echo "⚠️ Legacy file: {} – move to public/ or delete"
```

### 2.3 Bundle-Analyzer (`ANALYZE`)

The **`ANALYZE`** environment variable toggles the built-in bundle-analyzer:

```bash
ANALYZE=true pnpm run build
```

- When `ANALYZE` is `true` the analyzer opens in the browser after the build finishes.
- **Side-effect:** The analyzer disables the _post-build cleanup_ (see §10) because the cleanup would delete the source-map files the analyzer needs.

## 3. Environment Variables & Service-Account Handling

> **⚠️ Security Reminder:** Only the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are committed to the repo. All **private** credentials are ignored via `.gitignore` and injected at runtime (CI or local dev).

| Variable                                   | Purpose                                                                                                | Example                     | Required?  |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_APARTMENT_COUNT`          | Number of apartments the complex has (drives ID generation)                                            | `12`                        | ✅         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION`                   | Cache-busting version for the service worker. Default: **`"1"`** (set in `scripts/replace-sw-env.js`). | `2025-10-30`                | _optional_ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST`       | **Client-side** emulator host (Firestore).                                                             | `localhost:9099`            | _optional_ |
| `FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST`                   | **Admin-side** emulator host (used by `firebase-admin` scripts).                                       | `localhost:9099`            | _optional_ |

### 3.1 Where to obtain `apartgo.json`

1. In the Firebase console, go to **Project Settings → Service accounts**.
2. Click **Generate new private key** → download the JSON file.
3. Rename it to `apartgo.json` and place it in the repository root **(never commit it!).**

### 3.2 CI handling of the service-account

The GitHub-Actions workflow decodes the secret and writes the file before any admin script runs:

```bash
echo "$FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT" | base64 --decode > apartgo.json
```

### 3.3 Default value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION`

The default `"1"` is injected by **`scripts/replace-sw-env.js`**:

```js
const envVars = {
  // …
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION || '1',
};
```

The value is concatenated into the service-worker cache name (`apargo-v${SW_VERSION}`) to force a cache bust on every version bump.

### 3.4 Authentication & Authorization Flow

The application implements a **session-based authentication system** with Firebase as the identity provider. Below are the key flows:

#### Email/Password Login Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Browser/Client
    participant Auth as Firebase Auth
    participant Session as /api/auth/session
    participant Admin as Firebase Admin SDK
    participant DB as Firestore

    User->>Auth: signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    Auth-->>User: Returns FirebaseUser with idToken
    User->>Session: POST { idToken }
    Session->>Admin: verifyIdToken(idToken)
    Admin-->>Session: Token verified ✓
    Session->>Admin: createSessionCookie(idToken)
    Admin-->>Session: HTTP-only session cookie
    Session->>Session: Set secure cookie (5-day expiry)
    Session-->>User: { status: 'success' }
    User->>Auth: onAuthStateChanged(callback)
    Auth-->>User: Firebase user state updated
    User->>DB: getUserByEmail(email)
    DB-->>User: User object (or null)
    opt New User First Login
        User->>DB: addUser(newUser)
        DB-->>User: Created user with ID
    end
    User->>User: Set appUser state & redirect to /dashboard
```

#### Google OAuth Login Flow

```mermaid

    participant Auth as Firebase Auth + Google
    participant Session as /api/auth/session
    participant Admin as Firebase Admin SDK
    participant DB as Firestore

    User->>Auth: signInWithPopup(GoogleAuthProvider)
    Auth->>Auth: Opens Google OAuth consent screen
    User->>Auth: User authorizes app
    Auth-->>User: Returns FirebaseUser with idToken
    User->>Session: POST { idToken }
    Session->>Admin: verifyIdToken(idToken)
    Admin-->>Session: Token verified ✓
    Session->>Admin: createSessionCookie(idToken)
    Admin-->>Session: HTTP-only session cookie (5 days)
    Session->>Session: Set secure cookie
    Session-->>User: { status: 'success' }
    User->>DB: getUserByEmail(firebaseUser.email)
    DB-->>User: User object (or null)
    opt New User First Login
        User->>DB: addUser({ name, email, avatar, role: 'user', apartment: '' })
        DB-->>User: Created user with ID
    end
    User->>User: Set appUser state & redirect to /dashboard
```

#### Authorization & Access Control

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User (Authenticated)
    participant App as React App
    participant Route as API Route
    participant Admin as Firebase Admin SDK
    participant Rules as Firestore Security Rules
    participant DB as Firestore

    User->>App: Request protected resource
    App->>App: Check user.role in context
    alt User is authenticated && apartment assigned
        App->>Route: GET /api/expenses (with session cookie)
        Route->>Admin: verifySessionCookie(sessionCookie)
        Admin-->>Route: Verified ✓
        Route->>DB: Query expenses for apartment
        Rules->>Rules: Check request.auth != null
        Rules->>Rules: Check apartment matches custom claim
        alt Rules pass (user owns apartment)
            DB-->>Route: Return apartment expenses
            Route-->>App: { expenses: [...] }
            App->>User: Render expenses dashboard
        else Rules fail (access denied)
            Rules-->>DB: DENIED
            DB-->>Route: Permission denied error
            Route-->>App: { error: 'Permission denied' }
            App->>User: Show error message
        end
    else User not authenticated || missing apartment
        App->>User: Redirect to /login
    end
```

#### Logout & Session Cleanup

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Browser/Client
    participant Auth as Firebase Auth
    participant Context as Auth Context
    participant Session as /api/auth/session
    participant Cookies as HTTP Cookies

    User->>Context: logout()
    Context->>Auth: signOut(auth)
    Auth-->>Context: Firebase user cleared
    Context->>Context: onAuthStateChanged triggered (user = null)
    Context->>Session: DELETE /api/auth/session
    Session->>Cookies: Delete 'session' cookie
    Session->>Cookies: Delete 'user-role' cookie
    Session-->>Context: { status: 'success' }
    Context->>Context: setUser(null)
    Context->>User: Redirect to /login
```

#### Session Validation on App Load

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Browser/Client
    participant App as App (Layout)
    participant Context as Auth Context
    participant Auth as Firebase Auth
    participant Session as /api/auth/session
    participant DB as Firestore

    User->>App: Page refresh or app load
    App->>Context: AuthProvider initializes
    Context->>Auth: setPersistence(browserLocalPersistence)
    Context->>Auth: onAuthStateChanged(callback)
    alt Session cookie exists & valid
        Auth->>Auth: Validates session from cookie
        Auth-->>Context: FirebaseUser (from session)
        Context->>DB: getUserByEmail(firebaseUser.email)
        DB-->>Context: User object with role & apartment
        Context->>Context: setUser(user), setLoading(false)
        Context->>User: Render protected routes
    else Session expired or invalid
        Context->>Session: DELETE /api/auth/session
        Session-->>Context: Session cleared
        Context->>Auth: signOut(auth)
        Context->>Context: setUser(null), setLoading(false)
        Context->>User: Redirect to /login
    end
```

#### Custom Claims for Authorization

Firebase custom claims are assigned via the `scripts/set-custom-claims.ts` script:

```bash
tsx scripts/set-custom-claims.ts <uid> <apartmentId> [role]
```

These claims are embedded in the ID token and used by Firestore security rules:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User logs in<br/>(has custom claims)"] -->|ID Token with claims| B["verifyIdToken()"]
    B -->|Claims embedded| C["request.auth.token"]
    C -->|apartmentId claim| D["Firestore Rules<br/>Check apartment access"]
    C -->|role claim| E["Firestore Rules<br/>Check admin access"]
    D -->|Matches doc apartment| F["✓ Access Granted"]
    D -->|No match| G["✗ Access Denied"]
    E -->|role == 'admin'| H["✓ Bypass apartment check"]
    E -->|role != 'admin'| I["✓ Use apartment check"]
```

## 4. Local Firebase Emulator

Running the full Firebase suite locally speeds up onboarding and enables offline testing.

### 4.1 Prerequisites

```bash
pnpm add -g firebase-tools   # or add firebase-tools as a devDependency
```

### 4.2 Start the emulators

```bash
# From the repo root
firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,functions,hosting,storage
```

The emulator configuration lives in `firebase.json`. It mirrors the production rules, but **security rules are relaxed** for `auth` (any user can sign-in with any email/password) – this is intentional for rapid local dev.

### 4.3 Point the app at the emulator

Create a **`.env.local.emu`** file (git-ignored) that overrides the host URLs:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9099   # Firestore (client)
FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9099               # Admin SDK scripts
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9099
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9199
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:5001
```

Load it before starting the dev server:

```bash
export $(cat .env.local.emu | xargs) && pnpm run dev
```

When the `*_EMULATOR_HOST` vars are present, `src/lib/firebase.ts` automatically connects the client SDK to the emulator, and any **admin** scripts (e.g., `scripts/check-database.js`) use `FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST`.

## 7. Firebase Security Rules

- **Location:** `firestore.rules` (project root).
- **Deploying:**

```bash
# Deploy only Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Core concepts

| Rule                                                        | Meaning                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request.auth != null`                                      | Only authenticated users can read/write.                      |
| `resource.data.apartment == request.auth.token.apartmentId` | Users can only access docs that belong to their apartment.    |
| `request.auth.token.role == "admin"`                        | Users with the `admin` custom claim bypass apartment scoping. |

> **Tip:** The `firebase.json` file also contains `hosting` rewrites that forward `/api/**` to the Next.js server and serve the service-worker files from the root.

---

## 8. Development Setup

```bash
# 1️⃣ Prerequisites
#    - Node.js ≥ 20.9.0 (as specified in package.json engines)
#    - pnpm (package manager)
#    - A Firebase project with Firestore, Auth & Cloud Messaging enabled
#    - `apartgo.json` (service-account) placed at the repo root (git-ignored)

# 2️⃣ Install pnpm (if not already installed)
npm install -g pnpm
# or via Corepack (recommended for Node.js ≥ 16.13)
corepack enable

# 3️⃣ Install the project
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/apargo.git
cd apargo
pnpm install   # clean install, respects lockfile

# 4️⃣ Install the TypeScript-runner used by scripts
pnpm add -D tsx          # local dev dependency (preferred)
# If you prefer a global install:
# pnpm add -g tsx

# 5️⃣ Environment
cp .env.example .env.local
#   Edit .env.local and fill in the public Firebase values + APP_APARTMENT_COUNT
#   (Optional) If you want to work against the emulator, also copy .env.example .env.local.emu

# 6️⃣ Development server
pnpm run dev       # starts Next.js on http://localhost:3000 with Turbopack

# 7️⃣ Production build (includes post-build cleanup)
pnpm run build

# 8️⃣ Serve the production build locally
pnpm run start
```

### 8.1 Running the Service-Worker locally

`next dev` serves the **entire `public/` directory as-is**, so the service-worker files are already reachable:

```
http://localhost:3000/sw-optimized.js
http://localhost:3000/sw.js
http://localhost:3000/firebase-messaging-sw.js
```

You can open the browser console and verify that the registration code (see § 12.1) successfully registers the worker.

---

## 9. Running TypeScript-based Scripts

Many maintenance/seeding scripts are written in **TypeScript**. They must be executed with a runtime that can transpile on-the-fly (`tsx`).

```bash
# Generic pattern
tsx scripts/<script>.ts
```

**Example shortcuts** (already defined in `package.json`):

```bash
pnpm run insert-users          # inserts demo users
pnpm run insert-apartments     # generates apartments collection
pnpm run insert-categories     # populates expense categories
pnpm run seed:expenses         # inserts sample expenses (if available)
pnpm run fix-apartments        # validates & repairs missing apartment assignments (if available)
pnpm run clean-fcm             # removes invalid FCM tokens (if available)
pnpm run deployment-checklist  # runs pre-deploy sanity checks (if available)
```

> **Why `tsx`?** It uses `esbuild` under the hood, providing near-instant start-up and full TypeScript support without a separate compile step.

---

## 10. Post-build Cleanup Details

The cleanup that removes webpack/Eslint caches and source-maps is hooked into **npm’s `postbuild` lifecycle**.

### What the script does

1. **Deletes heavy caches** – `./.next/cache/webpack`, `./.next/cache/eslint`.
2. **Strips source-maps** – removes any `*.map` files under `.next/static` when `NODE_ENV=production`.
3. **Adds a minimal serverless optimisation file** (`.next/standalone/optimize.js`) that forces the import of a tiny “node-optimization” shim (used by the standalone build).

### Interaction with `ANALYZE`

When `ANALYZE=true` the bundle analyzer is active **and the post-build cleanup is intentionally skipped** so that source-maps remain for the visualisation. The script respects this automatically.

### Skipping the cleanup manually

If you need the build artefacts for local debugging, run:

```bash
pnpm run build --ignore-scripts   # bypasses all lifecycle scripts
```

> **Caution:** Skipping the cleanup will increase bundle size and may cause CI-related timeouts on Netlify.

---

## 11. Thin-Client / Heavy-Server Pattern

> **What does this mean?** UI components are intentionally lightweight; any heavy data-manipulation or bulk writes are performed by **admin scripts** or server-only API routes.

| Area                   | Thin-Client Example                                              | Heavy-Server Example                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User onboarding**    | A sign-up form that calls `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`.      | `scripts/insertUsers.ts` bulk-creates many demo users in a single batch.                                                   |
| **Apartment creation** | UI only shows a list of generated IDs (`getApartmentIds()`).     | `scripts/insertApartments.ts` writes every ID to Firestore in one transaction.                                             |
| **Expense splitting**  | UI renders expense rows, calculates per-apartment share locally. | `scripts/fix-user-apartments.ts` audits the entire `users` collection to repair missing apartment fields.                  |
| **FCM token cleanup**  | UI never touches tokens directly.                                | `scripts/clean-fcm-tokens.ts` iterates over all users, validates each token with Firebase Admin, and removes invalid ones. |

### Running heavy scripts in production

Add the `--env prod` flag to any script that must target the **production** Firebase project:

```bash
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$PROD_SA_BASE64 CI=true NODE_ENV=production tsx scripts/insertUsers.ts
```

The script reads the base-64 secret from the CI environment and connects to the live project.

---

## 12. Service-Worker Registration & Build-time Injection

### 12.1 Registration code (place in a top-level component, e.g., `src/app/layout.tsx`)

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    // Register the optimized worker first; fallback to sw.js if it fails
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register('/sw-optimized.js')
      .catch(() => navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js'));
  }
}, []);
```

### 12.2 How `replace-sw-env.js` works

During `npm run build` the script:

1. Reads the **public** Firebase variables from `process.env`.
2. Opens `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js` and `public/sw-optimized.js`.
3. Replaces placeholder strings like `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` with their **actual values** (or the literal `undefined` if missing).
4. Fails the build in CI if any **required** variable is absent.

> **Result:** Service workers can’t access `process.env` at runtime, but they receive the needed config values at build time.

### 12.3 `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION` fallback

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION` is **not** defined, `replace-sw-env.js` injects `"1"` as the default. The value is interpolated in the service-worker cache name:

```js
const CACHE_NAME = `apargo-v${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION || '1'}`;
```

Changing the version (e.g., bumping it in `.env.local`) and rebuilding forces a **cache bust** on the next page load.

## 13. Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

| Stage                | Command                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Install**          | `pnpm install`                                                                  |
| **Lint**             | `pnpm run lint`                                                                 |
| **Test**             | `pnpm test` (Jest)                                                              |
| **Build**            | `pnpm run build` (production)                                                   |
| **Deploy (Netlify)** | Runs only on `main` after a successful build; uses `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret. |

### Required secrets (repo Settings → Secrets)

| Secret                     | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Base-64-encoded `apartgo.json`.                           |
| `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`       | Netlify personal access token for automated deploys.      |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`   | All public Firebase vars – safe to store as repo secrets. |

### Lint in CI

_Contrary to a previous comment, lint **is** executed in CI._ It fails the workflow if any ESLint error is reported, ensuring that no lint-only issues slip through.

---

## 14. Testing Strategy

### 14.1 Unit Tests (Jest)

- **Run all tests:** `pnpm test`
- **Watch mode:** `pnpm test -- --watch`
- **Coverage:** `pnpm test -- --coverage` (CI enforces `>80 %` line coverage).

The `jest.setup.ts` file **mocks** Firebase modules so unit tests run without network access. The mock includes the essential methods (`signInWithEmailAndPassword`, `signOut`, `addDoc`, `setDoc`, `getDoc`, …).

### 14.2 Integration / End-to-End Tests

- **Framework:** Playwright (optional, not shipped by default).
- **Installation:**

```bash
pnpm add -D @playwright/test
pnpm dlx playwright install
```

- **Run locally:** `pnpm run test:e2e` (add a script entry if you want).

### 14.3 Emulator-based testing

When testing code that talks to Firestore/Auth, spin up the emulator (see § 4) and point the client at it via the `*_EMULATOR_HOST` variables. This gives you a **real** backend without network latency.

---

## 15. Linting & CI Enforcement

- **`pnpm run lint`** runs `next lint` (ESLint with the Next.js preset).
- **Ignored files:** `.eslintignore` excludes generated files (`.next/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`).
- **Scripts folder:** All scripts in `scripts/` **are linted** (they are part of the source tree). No explicit exclusion is required – this ensures that maintenance scripts stay clean.
- **CI behavior:** The GitHub Actions workflow **runs** lint; a lint failure aborts the workflow and blocks merges.

---

## 17. Deployment Checklist Failures & Custom-Claim Assignment

### 17.1 Checklist script failures you may see

| Failure                           | Explanation                                              | Remedy                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`netlify.toml` missing**        | The Netlify config isn’t present.                        | Add a minimal `netlify.toml` (see Docker guide for an example).           |
| **Plugin not configured**         | `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` missing.                        | Add it under `[plugins]` in `netlify.toml`.                               |
| **Standalone output not enabled** | `output: 'standalone'` is commented out.                 | Uncomment the line in `next.config.ts` if you need a Docker-ready bundle. |
| **Missing API route**             | Expected file (`src/app/api/health/route.ts`) not found. | Verify the file exists; run `pnpm run build` to surface routing errors.   |

### 17.2 Custom-Claim Assignment script

> **File:** `scripts/set-custom-claims.ts`  
> **Purpose:** Assigns `apartmentId` and `role` custom claims to a Firebase Auth user. This is required for the security rules that gate access by apartment.

```bash
# Example usage (run from the repo root)
tsx scripts/set-custom-claims.ts <uid> <apartmentId> [role]
#   <uid>         – Firebase Auth UID of the user
#   <apartmentId> – e.g. G1, F1, …
#   [role]        – optional, defaults to "resident"
```

The script reads the service-account (`apartgo.json`) via `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts`, so it works both locally (when the file exists) and in CI (when the base-64 secret is decoded).

---

## 18. Contribution Guidelines

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Below is a concise checklist:

1. **Fork** → **branch** (`git checkout -b feat/awesome-feature`).
2. Follow **TypeScript strict mode** and existing **ESLint** rules (`pnpm run lint`).
3. Write **unit tests** for new logic (≥ 80 % coverage).
4. Run the full suite locally: `pnpm test`.
5. Verify the **post-build cleanup** works (`pnpm run build`).
6. Open a PR against `main`. At least **one approving review** is required and the CI must pass.
7. Commit messages must follow **Conventional Commits** (`feat: …`, `fix: …`).

---

## 19. Versioning & Release Process

1. **Bump version** using pnpm (which updates `package.json` and creates a Git tag):

```bash
pnpm version patch   # or minor / major
git push --follow-tags
```

2. **Generate changelog** (automated via `standard-version` if installed):

```bash
npx changelog-generator -p    # prepend new entries to CHANGELOG.md
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: update changelog for vX.Y.Z"
git push
```

3. **Deploy** – Netlify automatically picks up the new tag and runs the CI pipeline.

> **Since v1.4.2**, the version string is also injected into `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION` (via `replace-sw-env.js`) to force a service-worker cache bust.

---

## 20. Best Practices & Accessibility

- **Tailwind purge** – Keep the `content` array up-to-date; missing paths cause dead CSS to linger.
- **WCAG AA contrast** – Use the **axe** Chrome extension or run `pnpm run lint:accessibility` (adds `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`).
- **ARIA** – Every interactive element must have an accessible name (`aria-label` or visible text).
- **Keyboard navigation** – All dialogs, menus and buttons must be reachable via `Tab`.
- **Testing** – Run `pnpm run lint && pnpm run test && pnpm run build && pnpm run start` locally; use Lighthouse to verify accessibility scores (`≥ 90`).

## 23. Docker Build Guide

A Docker image is useful for local production testing or for deploying to container-based platforms (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run).

### 23.1 Enable standalone output

Uncomment the line in **`next.config.ts`**:

```ts
// output: 'standalone',
output: 'standalone',
```

This tells Next.js to emit a self-contained build that can run without a separate `node_modules` directory.

### 23.2 Minimal Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# -------------------------------------------------
# 1️⃣ Build stage – compile the app
# -------------------------------------------------
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

# Install pnpm
RUN npm install -g pnpm

# Install only production-ready deps (including dev-deps for the build)
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy source files
COPY . .

# Build the app (includes post-build cleanup)
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_APARTMENT_COUNT
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION
ARG ANALYZE=false

ENV NODE_ENV=production
RUN pnpm run build

# -------------------------------------------------
# 2️⃣ Runtime stage – thin image for serving
# -------------------------------------------------
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Install pnpm
RUN npm install -g pnpm

# Copy only what is needed from the builder
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json /app/pnpm-lock.yaml ./
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.ts ./
COPY --from=builder /app/tsconfig.json ./

# Install only production dependencies (skip dev deps)
ENV NODE_ENV=production
RUN pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile

EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT=3000

# Use the Next.js start script
CMD ["pnpm", "run", "start"]
```

### 23.3 Build & Run

```bash
# Build the image (replace <tag> with whatever you like)
docker build -t apargo:<tag> .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=… \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_APARTMENT_COUNT=12 \\
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION=2025-10-30 \\
  apargo:<tag>
```

> **Tip:** Because the service-worker cache name contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_VERSION`, changing that env-var and rebuilding the image forces a cache-bust for any existing clients.

### 🎉 You’re all set

With the updated documentation you should now have:

- A crystal-clear picture of the **routing model** and how to migrate any leftover `src/pages` files.
- Full guidance on **environment variables**, **emulator usage**, and **service-worker build-time injection**.
- Explicit instructions for **Docker** builds, **bundle analysis**, **TSX script execution**, and **manual SW cache busts**.
- Updated references for the **custom-claim script**, **legacy messaging worker**, **fix-notifications-display** helper, and the caching strategies inside `sw-optimized.js`.

If anything still feels fuzzy, open an issue or submit a PR – keeping the docs in sync with the code is a shared responsibility. Happy coding! 🚀
